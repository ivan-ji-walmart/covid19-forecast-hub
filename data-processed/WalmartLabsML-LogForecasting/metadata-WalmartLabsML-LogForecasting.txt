team_model_designation: primary
methods: (US/State) Ensembing of prophet logstic model and extended Kalman filter forecasting model. The logistic growth prophet forecasting model fit using case counts and deaths as features. The extended Kalman filter fit with time series Death data using a two-step process of prediction and correction under some conditions can ensure that we can have a self-correcting forecastings.
team_funding: Walmart
data_inputs: JHU CSSE confirmed case counts and deaths
methods_long: The ensembled Models are built by Propeht model with logistic growths and extended Kalman Filter for self-correcting to forecast the US cumulative deaths. By sampling from uniform distribution to get the quantiles.
